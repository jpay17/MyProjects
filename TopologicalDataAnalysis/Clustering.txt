#presumably we know how many people we've scanned
#So we know how many clusters to look for
#par(new=TRUE) ... type in between all the plots to keep them

If we determine clusters in the distance graph we can go back and say that those
clusters were actually saying xCoordinate's barcode is similar to yCoordinate's barcode.
So really we want to determine clusters based on x and z points or based on y and z points.
